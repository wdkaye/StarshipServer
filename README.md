# StarshipServer
## UNDER CONSTRUCTION :(

#### Tue 12/17/2024 2 PM

I am attempting to implement Login using Microsoft Identity, combining
code samples from my classwork and the textbook.  I should've guessed,
the textbook method is more complex and relies on previous chapters that
I've skipped over.  As of this writing the page doesn't quite work, and
I'm deep into a debugging phase.

The SQL database has been working for me up until this commit, now the
data only appears after I attempt to login.  Still investigating.

I would invite onlookers to judge this fairly and at any time.
Meanwhile I will continue to improve this work until I see said
judgement.

Starship DTO class has been added.  Now there is evidence of meaningful interaction between the 5 tables (starships, hulls, reactors, thrusters, weapons).

Next steps (resuming work on Monday afternoon):
- deploy to Azure
- User authentication
- tidy up
