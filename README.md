Login is now functional.  Currently working on deployment.

I would invite onlookers to judge this fairly and at any time.
Meanwhile I will continue to improve this work until I see said

Starship DTO class has been added.  Now there is evidence of meaningful interaction between the 5 tables (starships, hulls, reactors, thrusters, weapons).

Next steps (resuming work on Monday afternoon):
- deploy to Azure
- User authentication
- tidy up
